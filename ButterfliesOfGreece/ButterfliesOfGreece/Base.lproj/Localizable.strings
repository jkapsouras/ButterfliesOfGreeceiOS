You can send also to this e-mail your photographs for identification of the species or confirmation of the record.\nThe standard naming of the 235 species, recognized that exist for sure in Greece has been adopted in the present version of this App. The ability of recognising the specie of a butterfly from a photo has been added in this version of the App. The App will be improved constantly, with the voluntary offer of its users. I express my sincere graditude to Mr. Theodosi Mamai and to Mr. Thanasi Elafropoulo for their comments during the implementation of this App. The constant offer of photos by members of the team Butterflies & Moths of Greece & Cyprus in FACEBOOK is especially noted. The contribution of Butterflies' photographs in order to be used in future versions of this App, will significantly improve the recognition accuracy. The voluntary contribution of the users will be posted (if they want to) from now on in http://www.pamperis.gr/THE_BUTTERFLIES_OF_GREECE/Anagnorise_ton_petaloudon_Recognition_of_butterflies_1.html\nSEPTEMBER 2020";

1. Twenty nine species are listed in: ΛΕΓΑΚΙΣ, ΑΝΑΣΤΑΣΙΟΣ: Ασπόνδυλα. In: ΛΕΓΑΚΙΣ Α. και Π. Μαραγκού (επιμέλεια έκδοσης), Το κόκκινο βιβλίο των απειλούμενων Ζώων της Ελλάδας. Ελληνική Ζωωλογική Εταιρεία. Αθήνα 2009
2. Three species are listed in:  NUMA, C.,  et al (2016). The status and distribution of Mediterranean butterflies. IUCN, Malaga, Spain. x + 32 pp.3.
3. Forty three species are listed in:  ΠΔ 67/1981
4. One species are listed in:  CITES
5. Eight species are listed in:  BERNE CONVENTION Appendix II
6. Three species are listed in:  92/43 HABITATS DIRECTIVE ANNEX II

"introduction_recognition" = " In this Application your photograph can be recognized by a system designed to compare photos with AI (Artificial Intelligence). My personal database of photographs had been used for training the AI system.
Accuracy can be further improved by adding more identified photos from the users. Users of this page are invited to upload their photos for recognition and then send them to contribute to the better training of the AI system. The more photographs in the training set, the bigger the accuracy of the system.
The results for some of the 235 species of butterflies of Greece are presented grouped in complexes; the reasons for this is that there are limits in identification using only photographs as input, in this AI (=Artificial Intelligence) system. For the moment recognition in the following species is not accurate:

\U2022 Pieris napi/balcana complex
\U2022 Colias crocea/erate complex
\U2022 Lepidea sinapis/juvernica complex
\U2022 Plebejus argus/idas/argyrognomon complex
\U2022 Polyommatus ripartii/timfristos complex
\U2022 Melitaea athalia/aurelia complex
\U2022 Hipparchia fagi/syriaca complex
\U2022 Hipparchia senthes/volgensis/cretica/christenseni/mersina complex
\U2022 Pseudochazara anthelea/amalthea complex
\U2022 Maniola telmessia/chia/hallicarnassus complex
\U2022 Gegenes pumilio/nostrodamus complex.

Identification of the above species could be improved only after a discovery of new crucial characters on the wings and better AI system.
It is recommended that users, before resorting to the Application, first search for the answer in their books, on various websites, etc., and then resort to the Application to confirm their conclusion. The research in the field, the suffering of the effort with perseverance and patience, the contact with the relevant books is the sure but uphill way, to improve in the recognition of the butterflies. Quick Recognition with Application is good but don't blindly trust it and always doubt the results.";
